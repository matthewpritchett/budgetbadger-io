**Bay Wolf Studios is excited to announce that Budget Badger is now 100% Free and Open Source.**

We are thankful for everyone who has supported Budget Badger and will continue to support and improve it.

Budget Badger was designed to make Budgeting as Easy as ABC from the beginning. We aspired to create an app for people that would allow them to budget without a concern of cloud services and subscription fees. As of today, we are going open source and are making all features 100% free. We believe in the power of the community, so we want everyone to assist us in shaping the future of this project.

To get started helping, you can create Feature Requests, file Bug Reports, and submit Pull Requests to help. You can also find the source code on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/baywolf-studios/BudgetBadger).
